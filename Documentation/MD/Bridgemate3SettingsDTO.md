&nbsp;

The Bridgemate3SettingsDTO contains all settings for the Bridgemate 3. It can be used as part of the [InitDTO](<InitDTO.md>) for [the intitialization of an event](<Initializeanevent.md>), or

it can be used as data for the [PutBridgemate3Settings command](<Overviewofcommunication.md#OverviewOfCommands>) to update settings. When used all settings must be provided.For readability many of the settings are expressed as enum values. This is not necessary, the use of integer values is allowed as well. In the image above the enum values will always be consecutively numbered starting wit zero. So Bm3ViewResultsOption.Disabled equals to zero and&nbsp; Bm3ViewResultsOption.OwnResutlsAndOtherResults equals to two.&nbsp;

The settings will be applied to all Bridgemate 3s for a section.The settings must be provided for each section, even if they are the same.
