# SectionDTO

![Image](<lib/SectionDTO.png>)

&nbsp;

The SectionDTO contains the movement for a group of participants for the duration of the session. It will be part of a [ScoringGroupDTO](<ScoringGroupDTO.md>) which is part of a [SessionDTO](<SessionDTO.md>) which is part of an [InitDTO.](<InitDTO.md>)

##### SessionGuid property

Required. A guid uniquely defining the session. Must be exactly 32 character long, uppercase and cannot contaim dashes or curly braces.

##### ScoringGroupNumber

Required. The number of the ScoringGroupDTO that the section belongs to. Must be greater than zero.

##### Letters property

Required. Uniquely defines the section within [the event](<Explanationofusedterms.md>).

##### Winners property

Required. Values can be 1 or 2. In the case of 2 winners the pair numbers in the section can be the same for North-South and East-West. Otherwise the pairnumbers in the section must be unique.

##### GameType property

Required. Values can be 10 for "Pairs", 20 for "Individual" and 30 for "Teams".

##### HasExplicitParticipations property

Optional, defaults to "false". When "true" the scoring program specifies the seating for every round of this section explicitly through [ParticipationDTOs](<ParticipationDTO.md>) with their RoundNumber property set. BCS stores these participations exactly as sent and does not calculate seatings from the movement. Use this for individual sessions and other formats where partnerships change between rounds. When "false" participations may only carry round number zero or one and BCS calculates the other rounds from the movement.

The value is fixed when the section is created: a later [SectionUpdateDTO](<SectionUpdateDTO.md>) must carry the same value.

##### Name property

Optional.

##### EWMoveBeforePlay property

Currently not supported.

##### MissingPair property

Optional. If specified it will indicate the number for the pair that is not playing. Its opponents will have a sit-out when they are scheduled to play against this pair. This value can&nbsp; be omitted as a sit-out can also be specified on the RoundDTOs. However, if used the graphic representation of sit-out tables in BCS will be improved.

**Note:** For a two winner section a positive number denotes the missing NS pair, a negative value denotes the missing EW pair.

##### IsCombiSection property

Optional. If "true" the section will host the two pairs that would have otherwise have a sit-out in their own sections. Specify the section that will provide the NorthSouth pair and the section that will provide the EastWest pair.

##### NorthSouthPairSectionLetters property

Required if IsCombiSection is "true". The letters for the section where the NorthSouth pair for each round comes from.

##### EastWestPairSectionLetters property

Required if IsCombiSection is "true". The letters for the section where the EastWest pair for each round comes from.

##### Tables property

Must be present as the SectionDTO contains the movement or a movement update for the section,

Array of [TableDTO](<TableDTO.md>).
